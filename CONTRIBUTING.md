## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository

To start contributing, first fork the repository on GitHub. This allows you to make changes in your own copy of the repository without affecting the main project.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Chat-Server.git
```
### 3. Create a New Branch
Before making any changes, create a new branch to work on. This ensures your changes are separate from the main branch.

```sh
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```
### 4. Make Changes
Make your changes or additions to the codebase. Ensure that your code adheres to the project's coding style and that it doesn't break any existing functionality.

If you are adding a feature, consider creating tests to verify your changes.
If you are fixing a bug, be sure to test thoroughly and provide steps to reproduce the bug if applicable.
### 5. Commit Your Changes
Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message describing what was changed and why.

```sh
git commit -m "Description of the changes made"
```
### 6. Push Your Changes
Push your changes to your forked repository:

```sh
git push origin my-feature-branch

### 7. Create a Pull Request
Go to the repository on GitHub and create a pull request (PR) to merge your changes into the main project. Make sure to provide a detailed description of the changes and the reasoning behind them in the PR.

### 8. Review and Discussion
Once your pull request is submitted, it will be reviewed by the project maintainers. They may ask for changes, suggestions, or improvements. Be open to feedback and update your PR accordingly.

### 9. Merging the Pull Request
If everything looks good and the pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main repository.
